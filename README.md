### My opinion
- If you use JS, you suck. Learn at least TypeScript.

- If you make multipurpose bots for Discord, you suck. Make something useful instead.

- all lives matter lol

Using VSC with Dark+ theme and bunch of extensions.

I've made lots of projects, like url shorteners, bots; cloned [**habrahabr**](https://habra.js.org/). I built [this bot](https://dedtihon.cf) for VK, [this one](https://vk.com/cubebot) and bunch of other useless bots.
